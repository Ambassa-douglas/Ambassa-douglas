A Donation Link is the simplist way for charties to recieve digital donations outside of their websites with no-code. Donors either click on short links (e.g evr.fund/demo) online or scan QR codes in-person on print media to access a fast an easy way to make a donation no matter where a charity engages with their supporter.

The donate button is the simplist form of evefund and it requires only two things to run the 'script' and the 'button'

This version of the script will be loaded loaded in at the start of page load.

```bash
https://evr.fund/demo?______
```
